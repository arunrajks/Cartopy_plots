This image shows an instance of upper ocean circulation, based on data from the GLORYS12, which is a global eddy-resolving physical ocean and sea ice reanalysis at 1/12Â° horizontal resolution covering the 1993-present altimetry period. GLORYS12 was designed and implemented within the framework of the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service [CMEMS](https://marine.copernicus.eu/)
